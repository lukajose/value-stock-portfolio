This project will try to obtain a few metrics to make smarter investment decisions. Our approach to invest will be to gather a few dividend metrics and only focus in value stocks rather than growth stocks.

There are a few key metric indicators we will be looking at before making a decision, some of these are:

- Dividend yield
- Dividend payout ratio
- Earnings per share (EPS)

The dividend yield ratio is calculated as follows, 


Let $ADS$ = Annual dividend per share , 


$PPS$ = Current price per share, then


$$ DY = { DAS \over PPS} $$

For example, company A at the end of the year has the current price of 100 per share, company A also paid out investors a dividend of $.5 per share on Feb, $1 on May and $1.1 on December, then the dividend yield will be.

$$ DY = {(0.5 + 1 + 1.1)  \over 100} = 2.6 \% $$ 


Now, the dividend payout ratio depicts how much of a companyâ€™s earnings are paid out to shareholders as opposed to being retained and re-invested into operations.

For example, if a company issued $20 million in dividends in the current period with $100 million in net income, the payout ratio would be 20%.

The dividend payout ratio is calculated as follows,

Let $TDA$ = Total divident amount revenue given to investors as dividends,

$NI$ = Total net income (profit)

$$ DPR = {TDA \over NI} $$

For our strategy we would want a very high DPR, we dont really care much about companies with low DPR. Higher dividends will come from companies with a higher DPR.




The earnigs per share (EPS) is calculated as follows,
