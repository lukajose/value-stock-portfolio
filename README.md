# Project objectives

This project will try to obtain a few metrics to make smarter investment decisions. Our approach to invest will be to gather a few dividend metrics and only focus in value stock rather than growth stocks.

There are a few key metric indicators we will be looking at before making a decision, some of these are:

- Dividend yield
- Dividend payout ratio
- Earnings per share (EPS)

The dividend yield ratio is calculated as follows, 


Let $DAS$ = Dividends per share , 

$DF$ = Dividend frequency,

$PPS$ = Price per share, then


$$ DY = { DAS * DF \over PPS} $$


The dividend payout ratio is calculated as follows,

The earnigs per share (EPS) is calculated as follows,
